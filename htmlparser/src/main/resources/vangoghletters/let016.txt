Letter|London , 20 Nov . 1873 .
Dearest Caroline ,
I wish you many happy returns ; it will surely be a festive day , this first birthday in your own house . I hope that this will be a very good and happy year for you both .
You’ve received my last letter , I hope . Write soon with news of how everyone is doing . I’m longing
  to hear something again .
Have you seen Theo yet? I heard that he arrived in The Hague last Wednesday .
Herewith a small contribution for the album .
I’m fine , but I’m up to my ears in work , and only have a moment .
Bid good-day to everyone in the Poten ; how I’d like to look in on you today . I wish you both the best .
Yours truly ,
Vincent .
