Sir ,
I have made enquiries in Paris about the book you ordered from me and they replied that it was out of print . If you want another volume , please give me the title , and I shall send it to you forthwith ; if not , I shall return your money on your next visit to me . Yours faithfully ,
H . Lamblot
successor to A . Jauffret .
