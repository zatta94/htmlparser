Letter|London , 30 March 1874
My dear Theo ,
In a letter from Pa and Ma I got a guilder from you to buy a pair of cuff links . Many thanks , old chap , but you shouldn’t have done it , you need your money more than I do .
Thanks for your letter of this morning . I was very glad to hear that Mauve is engaged to Jet C . That’s wonderful . I’m glad that you’re so well .
It’s good that you’ve read the book by Bürger ; read about art as much as possible , especially the Gazette des Beaux-Arts &amp ; c .
 
Above all , be sure to find out as much as possible about paintings . The Apol that we have here now is very beautiful , last year he painted a similar subject and I found it better and fresher than this one .
I’m glad that you go to Uncle Cor’s occasionally . You see things there that you never find at the gallery in The Hague .
I’m also busy at present and am glad of it , because that’s what I need .
Adieu , old chap , keep your chin up , and I wish you well . Give my regards to Van Iterson .
Vincent
As regards Anna , I haven’t heard anything more .
