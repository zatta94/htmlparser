Letter|My dear Theo ,
Don’t be cross with me that I’ve come all of a sudden . I’ve thought about it so much and I think we’ll save time this way . Will be at the Louvre from midday , or earlier if you like . A reply , please , to let me know when you could come to the Salle Carrée . As for expenses , I repeat , it comes to the same thing . I have some money left , that goes without saying , and I want to talk to you before spending anything . We’ll sort things out , you’ll see . So get there as soon as possible . I shake your hand .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
