My dear Caroline ,
I feel the need to write a few words to you .
What happy days those were ‘when we were together’ . You must know that I haven’t forgotten you , but writing doesn’t come to me as easily as I’d like .
I have a rich life here , ‘having nothing , yet possessing all things’ . Sometimes I start to believe that I’m gradually beginning to turn into a true cosmopolitan , meaning not a Dutchman , Englishman or Frenchman , but simply a man .
  With the world as my mother country , meaning that tiny spot in the world where we’re set down . But we aren’t there yet , but I follow after , if that I may apprehend .
And as our ideal that which Mauve calls ‘that’s it’ .
Old girl , adieu .
Yours truly ,
Vincent
A handshake for you and Willem , like old times , so that it hurts your fingers .
